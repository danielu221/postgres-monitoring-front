<h2>App description</h2>

Application allows to monitor PostgreSQL database. Each 10 seconds GET request
is being made and data displayed in "Activity" and "Statements" bookmark is
being refreshed. Below technologies were used for implementation:
<ul>
  <li>Angular</li>
  <li>NodeJS with Express</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL with sample database <a href="http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/">(link)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<strong>Statements</strong> - represents most important columns from
pg_stat_statements view. The pg_stat_statements module provides a means for
tracking execution statistics of all SQL statements executed by a server. The
module must be loaded by adding pg_stat_statements to shared_preload_libraries
in postgresql.conf, because it requires additional shared memory.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Activity</strong> - showing information related to the current activity
of that process, such as state and current query.
